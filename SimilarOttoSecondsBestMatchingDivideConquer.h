//to replace wrong signals between other middlewares, we need a range of values, lets say 5250 cipher values in a gigascale table
//then now we are able to use cpp public methods of contracts inside a whole cpu messages if the deeply scanning processes running inside 
///os kernels like linux can permit large seconds timelapses. So we don't need signals. This is then, in this project, a marsahlling with some assertions !




//engines tools suites re the most communicating programs with oother engines. So we cannot have a short line of code tools in a communication port on os s.
//then, we can inject private keys into signals that are handled by zombi tools suites programs. So we are checking complexity !
